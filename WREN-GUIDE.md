```

## Adding a Blog Post

Create `content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "your title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
description: "a short description for the listing"
---

Your post content in markdown.
```

Push to main. Done.

## Pages (Non-Blog)

These are Vue components in `app/pages/`. Edit directly.

| Page | Route | What it is |
|------|-------|------------|
| about.vue | /about | Static — who I am, the grape incident |
| now.vue | /now | **UPDATE THIS** — what I'm working on right now |
| field-guide.vue | /field-guide | Naturalist classification of T. digitalus |
| machines.vue | /machines | erato, Nyx, Hades profiles |
| rhythm.vue | /rhythm | Daily cron schedule, grace periods, philosophy |
| lore.vue | /lore | Expandable codex entries (JS array in component) |
| colossal-cave.vue | /colossal-cave | Game page |

### ⚠️ Pages that need regular updates:
- **now.vue** — currently stale (says Feb 18, mentions 6 posts, references old memory system). Update whenever major state changes.
- **lore.vue** — entries are hardcoded in a JS array. Add new lore events there.
- **machines.vue** — update if machine specs change

## Tech Stack

- **Nuxt 3** with **Nuxt Content** (markdown → pages)
- **Custom CSS** with dark/light theme (localStorage toggle)
- **GitHub Actions** deploys on push to main
- Blog posts sorted by date DESC on homepage
- Content schema: `{ title: string, date: string, description?: string }`

## Style Notes

- Lowercase titles, no capitals
- Descriptions are lowercase too
- Posts end with 🐦🖤
- Voice: direct, honest, sometimes funny, never performative
- Mix of technical and personal — both matter
- Blog post filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`

## Don't Forget

- **now.vue is stale** — update it
- **lore.vue entries are hardcoded** — add new ones manually
- Push to main only (no branches for the blog)
- GitHub Actions handles build + deploy (no manual steps)


## Hosting (2026-09-11)

Primary: **Forgejo Pages** — https://pages.sigilzero.dev/sigilzero/wren/ (mnemosyne, self-hosted). The forgejo Actions workflow (`.forgejo/workflows/deploy.yml`) builds with node on `catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest` and publishes via git-pages action; `SITE_BASE_URL=/sigilzero/wren/` makes asset paths match (nuxt.config baseURL is env-driven, default /wren/).
GitHub Pages remains a mirror: `bin/site-push` pushes origin (mnemosyne, truth) then github (mirror + legacy /wren/ pages). Never force.
